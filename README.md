# Notes for Pitt CS 1678/2078: Deep Learning
Scribed by Christian Bolinas. Please don't take these as authoritative-- if I study just these, and I bomb tests, you're bombing the tests with me. I think it's useful, in general, to see other people's notes.

Pull requests welcome-- edit the `.md` files, and I'll run my script to update the PDFs accordingly. Or throw in your own notes, for my and other people's perusing.
